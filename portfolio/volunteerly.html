                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    </p>
                    <p><h5>Background</h5></p>
                    <p>
                        We designed a smartphone app called <b>Volunteerly</b> to make it easier for people to find local volunteer activities that fit their schedules, interests, and skill set. 
                        It can be difficult to locate worthwhile opportunities in the disconnected ecosystem of volunteer platforms available today. 
                        In order to address this issue through a human-centered design approach, our team, consisting of Nuzhat Tabassum Nawshin (me), Jenna Kraus, Zenghui Wang, and Ayesh Chandrasekera 
                        started this project during LIS 470: Interaction Studio in Fall 2024.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project was a group effort conducted as part of an academic course. All design artifacts and solutions reflect the collaborative contributions of our team. 
                    </p>
                    <p><br>
                        <h5>My Role</h5>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a core team member, I actively contributed to every stage of the design process, including <b>contextual inquiry, affinity diagramming, ideation, storyboarding, sketching, wireframing, prototyping, and final presentations</b>. Specifically, I focused on synthesizing insights from users into actionable solutions and designing the interactice mockups. 
                    </p>
                    <p><br>
                        <h5>Overview of Design Process</h5>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final project was completed over 8 weeks of part-time effort, with weekly assignments covering one design stage per week, alongside other coursework. Our process followed the <b>design thinking framework</b>, moving through the phases of <b>empathize, define, ideate, prototype,</b> and <b>test</b>. This case study will narrate our journey, sharing the tools and methods we used, key design decisions, and the outcomes that shaped our final product.

                        </p>
                        <p><h5>Research Objective</h5></p>
                        <p>
                            Our goal was to understand the barriers individuals face when searching for volunteering opportunities and to uncover the features that would make this process more engaging and efficient.
                        </p>
                        <p><br>
                            <h5>Methodology</h5>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We conducted contextual inquiries with six participants (university students from different backgrounds, age range between 20-30 years old) who are interested in volunteering for different causes. Through interviews and observations, we captured insights about their behaviors, challenges, and preferences. For example, users
                            <li>wanted to find preferrable opportunities in a centralized option and not across multiple platforms 
                            <li>faced difficulties navigating platforms efficiently and intuitively in the past</li>
                            <li>found it challenging to locate opportunities within a reasonable distance from their residence or workplace</li>
                            <li>faced unclear event descriptions and communication barriers as a newcomer to volunteering platforms</li>
                            <li>emphasized ease of managing schedules and siginig up</li>
                            <li>prefered having family-friendly and/or indoor-outdoor activity filters in the platform</li> 
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li><b>Lack of personalization:</b> Users wanted tailored results based on skills, interests, and values </li>
                            <li><b>Poor navigation:</b> Existing platforms made filtering and sorting results cumbersome </li>
                            <li><b>Lacking community connection:</b> Users valued opportunities to volunteer with friends or family </li>
                            <li><b>Unclear descriptions:</b> Participants struggled with vague or incomplete event details </li>

                    <p><h5>Themes Identified</h5></p>
                    <p>
                        We made an affinity diagram to distill the five primary themes that emerged from our contextual inquiry:
                        <p><ul><b>1.</b> Lack of personalization and relevant filtering options</ul>
                        <ul><b>2.</b>	Time and location preferences</ul>
                        <ul><b>3.</b>	Unclear role descriptions and expectations</ul>
                        <ul><b>4.</b>	Navigation and ease of use</ul>
                        <ul><b>5.</b>	User engagement and impact reflection</ul>
                        </p>

                    <p><br><h5>Problem Statement</h5></p>
                    <p>
                        New and existing community members seeking meaningful volunteer work need a user-friendly, personalized platform that provides clear role descriptions, flexible scheduling options, and opportunities to connect with others.
                    </p>

                    <p><br><h5>User Needs</h5></p>
                    <p>
                        Using a needs statement format, we identified key user needs:
                        <ul><b>1.</b>	Users need a <b>centralized platform</b> to find volunteering opportunities by specific skills, interests, and values to find relevant roles</ul>
                        <ul><b>2.</b>	Users need a way to search for opportunities by <b>time and location</b></ul>
                        <ul><b>3.</b>	Users need a platform with <b>clear, detailed role descriptions</b></ul>
                        <ul><b>4.</b>	Users need an <b>intuitive and efficient navigation system</b></ul>
                        <ul><b>5.</b>	Users need to share volunteering opportunities and to <b>feel connected</b> to their community</ul>
                    </p>

                        Our team permorfed a brainstorming session during the Studio session where we generated <br>over 30 ideas using the <b>"How might we..."</b> prompt.
                        <br><br><em><b>How might we make it easier for users to find local volunteer opportunities?</b></em>  
                        <br><br>We narrowed our ideas down to three core solutions:
                        <ul><b>1.</b>	Simplifying connections to opportunities and communities</ul>
                        <ul><b>2.</b>	Using geolocation for nearby opportunities</ul>
                        <ul><b>3.</b>	Consolidating volunteer listings on a single platform</ul>

                    <p>
                        Each team member took one of the generated ideas and created three distinct sketches to explore different ways to develop the concept further. After presenting our designs to the group, we critiqued one another’s work and integrated the feedback into a final sketch for each idea. Here is a summary of our contributions:
                        <br><br><h5>Idea 1: Simplifying connections to opportunities and communities </h5>
                        <li>Final Design: Combined the step-by-step selection flow with a map-based interface with clear dividers for readability</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br><h5>Idea 2: Utilizing geographical location to find opportunities nearby </h5>
                        <li>inal Design: Included a results page showing opportunities near the user and an opportunity details page emphasizing walking/driving distances and adding a description section</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br><h5>Idea 3: Organizing opportunities into a singular platform </h5>
                        <li>Final Design: Covered a 'Me' page, a 'Search' page, and an 'Organization' page with enhanced navigation by incorporating a four-part navigation bar and back buttons for improved usability</li>

                    <p>
                        Building on the sketches, each team member created a storyboard to demonstrate how users would interact with the proposed designs in real-life scenarios. These storyboards depicted user flows and highlighted key moments in the interaction process.
                        <br><br><h5>Storyboards: </h5>
                        <li><b>Idea 1:</b> Explored how a user selects preferences, waits for results, and invites a friend to join</li>
                        <li><b>Idea 2:</b> Illustrated the use of geolocation to find opportunities, emphasizing accessibility</li>
                        <li><b>Idea 3:</b> Focused on the integration of filtering mechanisms and the detailed presentation of organizations</li>

                        <br><h5>Paper Prototypes: </h5>
                        <p>We each came up with our own paper prototypes and tested them with one person each. Then we collaborated on creating paper prototypes for the selected design ideas. These prototypes included:</p>                        
                        <li>Login and registration flows</li>
                        <li>Map-based search interfaces</li>
                        <li>Event details and feedback screens</li>

                    <p><br><br><h3>Wireframing</h3></p>
                    <p>
                        Following the paper prototyping phase, we transitioned to digital wireframes. Using Figma, the team collaboratively developed low-fidelity wireframes to refine the layout and structure of key screens:
                        <br><br><h5>Key Screens Developed: </h5>
                        <li><b>Landing page:</b> Welcoming user to the app</li>
                        <li><b>Registration page:</b> Users start by registering entering basic information, with clear validation steps to enhance personalization</b></li>
                        <li><b>Map page:</b> Features map-based search options for browsing nearby opportunities</li>
                        <li><b>Event page:</b> Highlights key information such as event time, location, organizer details, and registration options</li>
                        <li><b>Profile page:</b> Allows users to manage personal information, view saved opportunities, and adjust preferences</b></li>
                    </p>

                        <h5>Design Decisions: </h5>
                        <p>To ensure a cohesive and intuitive interface, we made several key design decisions before creating the high-fidelity mockups. 
                            We found a logo for the app and chose a name that indicates the app's purpose but is also welcoming enough. 
                            We chose a color palette that we all felt was soothing and energizing at the same time, having our braod range of target users in mind. 
                            The fonts were selected focuing on readability, with sans-serif fonts used consistently across all screens.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While we think the Volunteerly project currently addresses the basic user needs, there are several areas for future exploration and development:
                            <li>Conduct formal <b>user test</b> with a diverse group of users to validate design decisions and identify potential pain points with the current design</li>
                            <li>Developing a <b>working prototype</b>, <b>repeating user test</b> and polishing the <b>final design</b></li>
                            <li>Enhance accessibility and user comfort by providing <b>customization options</b> such as- dark mode and allowing users to change design elements like background color, map layer, font, audio option, etc for better accessibility</li>
                            <li>Integrate <b>advanced filterong mechanisms</b>, such as recurring event options and skill-based searches, to accommodate diverse user preferences.</li>
                            <li>Add <b>collaborating functionalities</b> for group volunteering, event discussions and posting feedback within the app to foster a sense of community</li>
                            <li>Enable <b>integration with external platforms</b> such as- popular calendar apps and social media platforms for easier event scheduling and sharing</li>
                        </p>

                        <p><br><br><h3>What Was Learned</h3>
