                    <h3>Problem statement</h3>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Urban stormwater management is a critical environmental challenge, yet public awareness of innovative solutions like green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) remains limited. Traditional educational approaches often fail to connect with diverse audiences or showcase real-world applications effectively. 
                        Our main guiding question was: 
                        <br><em><b>How can a locative audio tour inspire deeper engagement and understanding of green stormwater infrastructure in Shorewood, Wisconsin?</b></em>
                    </p>
                    <p><br>
                        <h3>Research and Insights</h3>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Competitive Analysis</b>
                        <br>As a first step, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of existing locative audio apps and storymaps, evaluating features such as usability, engagement strategies, and content depth. This helped us identify:
                        <li>The need for concise, engaging scripts tailored to diverse audiences</li>
                        <li>Opportunities to incorporate soundscapes and ambient audio for added immersion</li>
                        <li>Gaps in navigation aids and accessibility features in similar projects</li>

                        <h3>Case Study</h3>
                    </p>
                    <p> <b>Research Objectives</b>
                        <li>Highlight the importance of GSI in urban areas</li>
                        <li>Educate participants about the specific GSI projects implemented in Shorewood</li>
                        <li>Create an immersive experience that blends environmental education with engaging storytelling</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br><b>Target audience</b>
                        <br>The primary audience includes local residents, students, and tourists interested in environmental sustainability and urban planning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <bR><b>Initial Protypes</b>
                        <br>We developed a locative audio mobile guided tour of recent and planned green stormwater infrastructure projects in the Village of Shorewood, Wisconsin. We created three versions of the same tour using VoiceMap and Echoes, apps selected from our competitive analysis samples for their functionalities. We also built our own custom web app using Leaflet.js. The story content was taken from an already existing storymap created by our partners in Milwaukee <em>(https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/63a66207e2eb4893a4d1d7f2de654c9d)</em>.

                    <p>
                        <br><b>Expert Evaluation</b>
                        <br>Seven collaborators, including myself, conducted a walkthrough of the initial tour using all three prototypes. We evaluated the route and content using a structured questionnaire and focus group discussions. The following map shows the route walked by each of the participants and identifies major pain points during the walk.

                        <br><br><b>Key recommendations</b> made by the experts included:
                        <br><br><b>1. </b>The need to adjust stop locations and radius for GPS-triggered audio playback for better flow and accessibility
                        <br><br><b>2. </b>Suggestions to re-design the route, refine scripts and using sound for a balanced and memorable experience                        
                        <br><br><b>3. </b>Recommendations for enhancing navigational clarity and audio-visual aids to make it more intuitive
                        <br><br><br><br><b>Finding The Best Solution</b>
                        <br><br>We also made comparison of the three technologies to find out the best solution for the case study.

                        <h3>Design and Scripting Process</h3>
                    </p>
                    <p> <b>Redesigning the Tour</b>
                        <br>Following the expert evaluation, several strategies were adopted for redesigning the tour:
                        <ul><b>1. Route Optimization: </b>Route was <b>shortened and looped back</b> to the starting point to improve accessibility and efiiciency.</ul>
                        <ul><b>2. Re-ordering tour stops: </b>The tour stops were <b>reordered and numbered</b> for a better flow and added variety - the ones outside the new route were removed, some were added along the route.</ul>
                        <ul><b>2. Script Revisions: </b>Content was <b>rewritten and reiterated</b> multiple times to emphasize relatable examples, numeracy facts, and reflection promtps for the audience.</ul>
                        <ul><b>3. Multimedia Features: </b>Enhanced auido-visual aids such as <b>images, maps and diagrams along with sound were integrated</b> effects for a more immersve experience.</ul>
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br><b>Key Design Principles</b>
                        <ul><b>Educational Depth: </b>Feature one unique type of green stormwater infrastructure at each site, provide detailed yet accessible explanations of each type and highlight one benefit.</ul>
                        <ul><b>Narrative Structure: </b>Maintain a structure for the narratives that looks like this: 
                        <ul><em>Site identification -> Numeracy facts about the particular GSI practice -> Gray Infrastructure problems in the particular area -> GSI benefits achieved -> Other relevant facts -> Critical thinking prompts -> Direction to next stop</em></ul>
                        <br><b>Immersive Soundscape: </b>Incorporate ambient sounds, such as water flowing and bees buzzing, to contextualize the environment.</ul>
                        <ul><b>Engagement Through Prompts: </b>Encourage critical thinking with questions like, <em>“How could you adapt similar solutions in your community?”</em></ul>
                        <ul><b>Ensuring safety: </b>Incorporate GPS-triggered audio playback and provide diretions and warnings for crossings through both audio and visuals so that the user doesn't have to keep looking at their phone while walking.</ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br><b>Beta Prototype Development</b>
                        <br>Since the comparison showed that the Leaflet.js prototype gave us more control over the design and functionalities, we developed a beta version of the app using Leaflet, HTML and CSS, featuring:
                        <li>Interactive map with clickable points, narrative and images for each stop</li>
                        <li>Automatic audio playback (trigered by GPS) integration for site-specific content</li>
                        <li>Audio and visual elements (images, maps, customized diagrams) to guide users seamlessly through the tour</li>
                    </p>

                        <li><b>Integrating sound</b> with the audio recordings</li>
                        <li>Making the UI more user friendly - <b>adding audio control panel</b> for better control over the narration, <b>adding swipe</b> control for images, repositioning the buttons and menu options, adding metadata, etc.</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project taught me the importance of blending creativity with structured design methodologies to create meaningful user experiences. I gained hands-on experience in:
                        <li>Conducting collaborative research and evaluations</li>
                        <li>Designing for locative and auditory mediums using modern web technologies</li>
                        <li>Using narrative to simplify complex environmental topics</li>    
                    </p>
                    <p>While this project is ongoing, it represents my growing expertise in user-centered design and my commitment to making environmental education engaging and impactful.</p>
