                <p class="portfolio-description">
                    This story map was created for the Graphic Design in Cartography course at UW-Madison. It is a longform infographic or “scrollytelling” map that follows a three-act narrative. The story features the changed migration patterns of California and Texas post-COVID and how more Californians are moving to Texas due to the discrepancy in housing costs after the pandemic. The narrative was designed using ArcGIS Storymaps. ArcGIS Pro, Adobe Illustrator, and Datawrapper platform were used to design maps and graphics. The story begins with some background context on the pandemic in the whole country and then it focuses on the COVID cases and housing costs in California and Texas by using a sidecar with images, text, and graphs. Since the story is told in a journalistic tone, a simple grey background with a calm teal shade is used for the whole story to give it a non-biased feel. The relationship between nation-wide median housing costs and domestic migration is shown with a simple choropleth bivariate map. The changes for California and Texas before and after the pandemic is presented using a vertical timeline. As the story unfolds, a combination of map, text, and video was used to provide a deeper look at the scenario for these two states. I used brick-red shades to show the outward migration pattern in California and shades of teal to show the inward migration of Texas throughout the story. The story concludes by showing the most recent on-going trends with a flowmap and some quotes from different sources which indicate that the pandemic may have changed the migration pattern in the U.S. for a long time.
