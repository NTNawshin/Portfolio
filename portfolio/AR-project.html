                    <h3>Problem statement</h3>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maps are powerful tools for storytelling, yet modern advancements in mobile and web mapping often prioritize technical capabilities over intuitive and engaging user experiences. 
                        This gap in design focus inspired me to explore how emerging technologies like Augmented Reality (AR) could transform storytelling and navigation on mobile devices. 
                        Through a case study, I aimed to develop user-centered design recommendations that enhance usability and engagement in place-based AR experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p><br>
                        <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My role was to design initial recommendations for a mobile AR app concept that guided users through a place of interest, blending storytelling with route visualization. 
                        One of the key challenges was to determine how multimedia elements could reduce visual clutter on smaller displays, making the interface more accessible and engaging. 
                        This led to the central question: 
                        <br><b><em>How can Augmented Reality (AR) transform map-based storytelling and navigation into an immersive, user-friendly experience?</em></b>
                    </p>
                    <p><br>
                        <h3>Methodology</h3>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Case study area</b>
                        <br>I chose the TUM campus as the case study area as it provided a focused and achievable scope for exploring AR-based navigation and storytelling within the constraints of time and resources.
                        <br><b>Target audience</b>
                        <br>The intended users were tourists visiting the historic 150-year-old TUM campus, as well as students—both new and returning—seeking an engaging and informative experience while navigating the campus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Workflow</b>
                        <br>I employed a mixed-methods approach, combining three steps:
                        <li><b>Comparative Study:</b> Analyzing storytelling approaches across printed, web, and AR/VR maps </li>
                        <li><b>Conceptual Design:</b> Developing sketches, wireframes, and mockups </li>
                        <li><b>Usability Testing:</b> Conducting semi-structured interviews and deriving actionable insights </li>

                            <li><b>Web maps</b> and AR apps often overload users with excessive dynamic elements leading to visual clutter, especially on small screens.</li>
                            <li>Users often find it difficult to interact with <b>AR/VR apps</b> due to inconsistent sizing and placement, or lack of clear affordances.</li>
                            <li>Many <b>AR/VR apps</b> struggle to  integrate storytelling and navigation seamlessly. Even when integrated, they are often siloed and forces users to switch between views or even apps.</li>

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <br>I developed high-fidelity mockups to translate conceptual ideas into a tangible design. The designs were made using Illustrator and then transformed into interactive mockups using Marvel. 
                                    The designs featured:
                                    <li><b>Navigation Options:</b> Blue lines in AR view and maps for route visualization</li>
                                    <li><b>Storytelling Elements:</b> Pop-ups, text, photos, and links integrated at POIs</li>
                                    <li><b>Filter Mechanisms:</b> Customizable POI categories (e.g., lecture halls, cafes)</li>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While feedback from the usability testing highlighted opportunities for improvement, such as clearer navigation markers and enhanced interactivity, these insights were documented as design recommendations for future iterations rather than directly implemented within the scope of this project.

                                    For usability testing, I conducted <b>semi-structured interviews</b> with 22 users, including TUM students and non-students (tourists). Participants were asked to perform <b>tasks</b> like navigate through the interactive mockups to reach a specific point of interest while <b>thinking aloud</b> to capture real-time feedback.
                                </p>

                                    <li>Users responded positively to the idea of an AR tour but highlighted a need for <b>more intuitive icons</b> and <b>clearer navigation markers</b> 
                                    <li><b>Shorter length of text</b> is preferrable </li>
                                    <li>Technical limitations in the mockup restricted interactivity, but feedback suggested that story <b>pop-ups and multimedia elements</b> would make it more engaging </li> 
                                    <li><b>Combining route visualization in AR and map</b> would be useful for navigation</b></li>
                                    <li><b>Emotional responses</b> were evoked by elements like - color palette (students could relate with university branding), photos (evoked "curiosity" and "nostalgia"), maps and route (evoked "safety" and "confidence"), narrative (felt "engaging") and fonts (felt "provocative") </b>

                                    <li><b>Implement Iterations:</b> Apply usability testing feedback to refine the design, such as improving icon clarity and interaction flow.</li>
                                    <li><b>Develop a Functional Prototype:</b> Transition from mockups to a working app prototype to conduct comprehensive user testing.</li>
                                    <li><b>Expand Testing:</b> Test with a broader and more diverse audience to validate the app's usability and scalability.</li>
                                    <li><b>Enhance Customization:</b> Add features like dark mode and user-controlled filters for accessibility and personalization.</li>
                                    <li><b>Integrate Gamification:</b> Consider elements like location-based quests or scavenger hunts to increase user engagement.</li>

                                    <p><br>This project marked a significant milestone in my journey as a researcher and aspiring UX designer. While it was conducted during a time when I was less focused on UX design as a career path, it allowed me to:</p>
                                    <li>Explore AR’s potential for enhancing user experiences</li>
                                    <li>Strengthen my analytical and prototyping skills</li>
                                    <li>Gain confidence in translating research insights into actionable designs</li>
                                    <p>This project served as a foundation that complements my recent experiences, showcasing my ability to approach UX challenges with creativity and critical thinking.</p>
