                        I started making this map as part of my teaching materials for Introduction to Cartography course at UW-Madison. Since I was new around town and I had not taken this course myself before, I did not have a finished map to display. As a demonstration, I would construct a little portion of this map using ArcGIS Pro and Adobe Illustrator each week while teaching my students how to use these programs. But I was guiding them through the process step by step until they felt confident using the tools and I only helped them complete their designs, leaving mine incomplete. I believed that it was only fair to my students (and myself) that I finish it too! 
                        <br><br>I had never made such a typography-heavy map before, so that was challenging for me to put my knowledge of the cartographic conventions and principles into practice. I wanted to experiment with different and fun font faces with tracking, kerning, leading and halos having the concepts of visual hierarchy and figure-ground in mind. Unlike any other labs I have taught or taken myself, the requirements for this one was quite explicit and demanding in terms of having a simple design and placing a lot of emphasis on the labeling. Working on it made me see how honing my Illustrator abilities and pushing myself to pay closer attention to details may improve my skill set.
